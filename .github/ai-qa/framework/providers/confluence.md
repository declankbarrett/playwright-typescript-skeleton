# Confluence — Cloud versus Server/Data Center

Use the [provider contract](operations.md). Determine deployment, space key/ID, page ID, parent, content representation and edit permission. A rendered Markdown preview is not a valid Confluence storage body; convert and validate supported rich content carefully, preserving links, tables and code blocks. Treat macros, attachments and embedded content as potentially lossy.

**MCP tool-name hints:** For Cloud, check Atlassian remote MCP capabilities such as `mcp_atlassian_mcp_confluence_search`, `mcp_atlassian_mcp_confluence_get_page`, `mcp_atlassian_mcp_confluence_create_page` and `mcp_atlassian_mcp_confluence_update_page`. A community server such as `sooperset/mcp-atlassian` may support Cloud and Server/DC. Verify tool names, schemas, deployment and write/read-back capability against the available tools; names here are hints, not guarantees.
## Deployment: Cloud

### Deployment and authentication

`*.atlassian.net` suggests Cloud (**◐ Inferred**); confirm using an approved read-only `serverInfo` deployment probe or MCP configuration, otherwise ask once. Cloud REST examples use the confirmed site's `/wiki` base, REST v2 page APIs where available, and Cloud Basic authentication with the configured email and API token environment variables (`ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`, `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`). Never print or persist credential values. Cloud v2 space IDs differ from Server/DC space keys. These variants are **unverified** until tenant capability and permissions are confirmed.

### Read and search

See the operation table under Server/DC (shared across deployments) and the Cloud recipes in [Confluence Cloud: read and search](#confluence-cloud-read-and-search) and [Confluence Cloud: create, update, append and verify](#confluence-cloud-create-update-append-and-verify).

## Deployment: Server/DC

### Deployment and authentication

A self-hosted URL suggests Server/DC (**◐ Inferred**); confirm through an approved read-only `serverInfo` deployment probe or MCP configuration, otherwise ask once. Use the configured context path and `/rest/api/content` v1. Authentication uses a configured PAT Bearer token or approved Basic authentication; tokens come from environment variables and are never printed. Recipes are **unverified** until confirmed against the actual instance.

### Read and find by title

| Named operation | MCP hint | CLI | REST and verification | Manual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L0 `docs.search` | Approved space-scoped page search | No CLI assumed | Cloud v2 cursor/v1 CQL or Server/DC spaceKey+title/CQL, paginate | Human-supplied page list, unverified |
| L0 `docs.get` | Approved page-get with body and version | No CLI assumed | Cloud v2/v1 or Server/DC content GET, preserve storage/version | Pasted page and source URL, unverified |
| L4 `docs.publish` `create` | Approved create only after preview/approval | No CLI assumed | Confirm space/parent, POST, read back new page | Paste-ready page in `outputs/`, not published |
| L4 `docs.publish` `update`/`append` | Approved update with current version | No CLI assumed | Fresh GET, diff/convert, versioned PUT, read back | Human diff and instructions in `outputs/`, not published |

| Operation | Confluence Cloud recipe | Confluence Server/Data Center recipe |
|---|---|---|
| Read | REST v2 `GET /wiki/api/v2/pages/{id}?body-format=storage` when supported; some capabilities still require v1 `/wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=body.storage,version`. | REST `/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=body.storage,version,space,ancestors` with base context path configured for the instance. |
| Search/list | Cloud v2 space/page listing with cursor links; use Cloud v1 CQL if required and supported. Scope by space, handle cursors. | For a known title, `GET /rest/api/content?spaceKey={space}&title={title}&expand=version,space`; for broader searches use supported scoped CQL with `start`/`limit`, respecting `_links.next`. Confirm title match and space before edits. |
| Create | Cloud v2 page create with space ID, parent ID and supported body representation; check format/permission first. | POST `/rest/api/content` with type `page`, space key, optional ancestors and `body.storage`; check instance API. |
| Update | Cloud v2 update includes current version and supported representation; re-read before and after write. | PUT `/rest/api/content/{id}` with type `page`, existing title, `body.storage` (`representation: storage`) and current version + 1; re-read immediately before and after write, do not overwrite stale edits. |
| Attach | Use supported edition-specific attachment endpoint and upload requirements; validate size and final attachment listing. | Use server attachment endpoint/context path and upload requirements; validate attachment listing. |

**Unverified transport recipes:** Cloud `/wiki` paths must not be copied onto an on-prem context path. Cloud v2 page IDs/space IDs and Server/DC space keys differ; content representations vary across APIs. An append is an **update**, not an independent insert: read current storage/version, convert the new material, preview the concatenation and diff, check that the version has not changed, PUT with version + 1, then verify the entire page. Never concatenate untrusted Markdown directly into storage XML. Escape text and attributes (especially links/URLs), validate URL schemes, and safely handle fenced-code delimiters including `]]>` in CDATA; do not trust a converter merely because it renders headings (e.g. blue H3), formatting, lists, tables or `ac:structured-macro` code blocks. When a converter cannot round-trip a page safely, preserve the source and request human intervention rather than stripping macros or overwriting rich content. Never log private page bodies or credentials.

**Manual fallback:** draft a page title, parent, space, paste-ready rendered content, link/attachment list and formatting review checklist for a human editor. For a scenario-only test plan using the Generic reference format, do not mix analysis, risk or other report sections into the page: use an H3 `Test Scenario 01 — <title>` heading (blue `rgb(0,82,204)` in the rendered Confluence page), the scenario body in the project's configured Scenario format (`method/scenario-format.md`: for `bdd`, bold GIVEN/WHEN/THEN/AND on separate lines with a blank evidence placeholder after each; for `steps`, a table of numbered actions and expected results with an empty Evidence column), relevant CLI/SQL/API snippets in code blocks after the corresponding step, and Result/Status (`PASS`/`FAIL`/`BLOCKED`)/Notes only at the end. Verify rich formatting in Confluence rather than assuming pasted Markdown preserves colour or code blocks. Mark **unverified / not published**; only an authorized read-back of the resulting page can verify it.

## Transport prerequisites and format conversion

For shell recipes, set credentials through the environment variables named in `conventions/integrations.md`; use Cloud Basic auth (email plus API token) or Server/DC PAT Bearer/basic auth. PowerShell `$Headers` must be constructed in memory from those variables and never displayed. Do not put secrets in JSON files, shell history, process arguments, logs or generated Markdown. Keep provider-specific requests bounded and read back every write.

**MCP:** Prefer an approved Confluence tool supporting the *confirmed* Cloud or Server/DC deployment. Read space/page/version and rendered content through the same tenant after a write; do not assume `get_page`, `update_page` or converter tools exist. **REST:** `$BASE` is a trusted configured URL: Cloud normally includes the `/wiki` context; Server/DC uses the configured on-prem context path without copying Cloud's `/wiki`. Curl's `-H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE"` reads a permission-restricted header file provisioned by an approved secret store outside the repository; only its path, not its contents, enters process argv. PowerShell `$Headers` is an approved in-memory authentication header dictionary; never put secrets in command history/logs. Examples are **unverified** until exercised with approved permissions. Encode titles, paths and query values, and keep reviewed `approved-*.json` request files out of source control.

**L0 deployment check:** an `*.atlassian.net` hostname suggests Cloud, but a custom hostname or proxy is ambiguous. Use a read-only configured Atlassian `serverInfo` capability if exposed, plus Confluence site/space API response or administrator confirmation to establish product and edition before choosing `/wiki/api/v2` versus Server/DC `/rest/api/content`. If the capability is unavailable, use pasted/manual input rather than probing another host. No page creation/update without L4 approval.

The Generic Server/DC converter treats Markdown headings (including blue H3), bold/italic, inline code, links, fenced code as `ac:structured-macro`, lists, tables, rules and paragraphs. That is *not* a guarantee of faithful round-trip conversion. Escape XML text/attributes and URLs; reject unsafe URL schemes, escape literal storage markup, and safely split or avoid `]]>` inside CDATA code blocks. Preview rendered Confluence storage, compare it to the source, and preserve existing macros/attachments. Never submit raw untrusted Markdown as `body.storage`; never silently append to or replace an existing page.

### Markdown-to-storage conversion rules

Port the Generic converter's conversion rules as follows; this is a documented transformation recipe, not a supplied client or a promise of lossless round-tripping.

| Markdown input | Confluence storage output |
|---|---|
| Fenced code block, optionally followed by a word-character language label | `ac:structured-macro` named `code`, `language` parameter set to the label (or `none`), `linenumbers` set to `false`, code inside `ac:plain-text-body` CDATA |
| Heading `#` through `######` | Corresponding `<h1>` through `<h6>` with inline formatting converted; H3 text wrapped in `<span style="color: rgb(0,82,204);">` |
| Horizontal rule consisting of three or more hyphens | `<hr/>` |
| Contiguous pipe-prefixed table rows | `<table><tbody>`; first row uses `<th>`, later rows `<td>`, separator rows containing only hyphens/colons/spaces are skipped |
| Contiguous `-` or `*` unordered list | `<ul>` with one `<li>` per item |
| Contiguous `1.` ordered list | `<ol>` with one `<li>` per item |
| Inline code | `<code>` with `&`, `<` and `>` escaped; protect code spans while applying other inline conversions |
| `**bold**` or `__bold__` | `<strong>` |
| `*italic*` or `_italic_` | `<em>` |
| `[text](url)` | `<a href="url">text</a>` after escaping/validating the attribute and URL |
| `~~strikethrough~~` | `<del>` |
| Non-empty ordinary line | `<p>` with supported inline conversions; blank lines are skipped |

The source converter handles these patterns with regular expressions and simple line grouping: it does not guarantee nested lists, nested formatting, escaped pipes, entities, arbitrary macros, or safe XML attribute/URL escaping. In particular, harden CDATA for literal `]]>`, validate URL schemes, escape XML text and attributes, and preserve existing macros/attachments. Preview rendered output and compare it to the source before any L4 write. Do not represent this rule table as an installed converter.

### Confluence Cloud: read and search

For v2, read a known page ID with `body-format=storage`, fetch its version and rendered body; list/search within the confirmed space using v2 pagination links or v1 CQL only if the tenant supports it. Cloud v2 space **ID** differs from a space key. Some rich-content and attachment operations still use Cloud v1; check capability before changing routes.

```text
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" -H "Accept: application/json" "$BASE/api/v2/pages/12345?body-format=storage"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$Base/api/v2/pages/12345?body-format=storage" -Headers $Headers -ErrorAction Stop
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" "$BASE/api/v2/spaces/67890/pages?limit=25"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$Base/api/v2/spaces/67890/pages?limit=25" -Headers $Headers -ErrorAction Stop
```

Follow returned cursor `_links.next`/`Link` rather than inventing offsets. If using Cloud v1 CQL, use `$BASE/rest/api/content/search?cql=<encoded-space-scoped-query>&limit=25` and inspect the tenant's continuation links.

### Confluence Cloud: create, update, append and verify

Confirm target parent/space ID and approved representation, preview the rendered page, then send a reviewed JSON request to v2 pages. For update/append, re-fetch current content/version and compare against the snapshot; the JSON must include the supported body representation and version number incremented by one. For append, concatenate **converted** new content with current storage only after a diff/approval; stale versions must stop. Re-fetch the page and compare title, body, parent and version after any write.

```text
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -X POST -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @approved-page.json "$BASE/api/v2/pages"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$Base/api/v2/pages" -Headers $Headers -ContentType "application/json" -InFile "approved-page.json" -ErrorAction Stop
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -X PUT -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @approved-update.json "$BASE/api/v2/pages/12345"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Put -Uri "$Base/api/v2/pages/12345" -Headers $Headers -ContentType "application/json" -InFile "approved-update.json" -ErrorAction Stop
```

Attachment support depends on edition/API: discover upload endpoint, content type, size limits and permissions, then verify the attachment listing; do not reuse a page JSON PUT as a multipart upload.

### Confluence Server/Data Center: read and find by title

The pinned Generic Server/DC tool first resolves `spaceKey` plus exact title and expands version/space; for a known ID it reads storage, version, space and ancestors. Confirm a unique title match and correct parent before any mutation.

```text
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" "$BASE/rest/api/content?spaceKey=QA&title=Approved%20Plan&expand=version,space"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$Base/rest/api/content?spaceKey=QA&title=Approved%20Plan&expand=version,space" -Headers $Headers -ErrorAction Stop
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" "$BASE/rest/api/content/12345?expand=body.storage,version,space,ancestors"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri "$Base/rest/api/content/12345?expand=body.storage,version,space,ancestors" -Headers $Headers -ErrorAction Stop
```

For larger result sets, use scoped CQL and paginate using returned `_links.next` or supported start/limit semantics. Treat 403/404 distinctly; neither proves the page does not exist.

### Confluence Server/Data Center: create, update, append and verify

For create, POST `type: page`, `title`, `space.key`, optional ancestors and converted `body.storage` (`representation: storage`). For update/append, fetch the complete current storage and version, verify expected parent/title, safely convert additions, preview old/new storage, then PUT `type: page`, title, body.storage and **current version + 1**. A stale version must block publication. Verify ID/version and rendered page after the write; a successful converter or PUT alone is not verified publication.

```text
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -X POST -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @approved-page.json "$BASE/rest/api/content"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "$Base/rest/api/content" -Headers $Headers -ContentType "application/json" -InFile "approved-page.json" -ErrorAction Stop
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error -X PUT -H "@$AUTH_HEADER_FILE" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @approved-update.json "$BASE/rest/api/content/12345"
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Put -Uri "$Base/rest/api/content/12345" -Headers $Headers -ContentType "application/json" -InFile "approved-update.json" -ErrorAction Stop
```

Attachments use instance-specific multipart endpoints; review approved files and verify IDs, not just a 2xx response. **Manual-only variant:** unsupported Cloud/Server representation, conversion loss, unavailable approved auth or inability to preserve macros → hand off the draft with `status: unverified / not published`, exact human formatting and read-back steps.
